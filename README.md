Official Rules of Rock Paper Scissors

Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) is a zero-sum game, typically played by two people using their hands and no tools. Players make hand shapes, each with a certain degree of power, ultimately leading to an outcome. RPS is popular worldwide, played by children and adults alike, and often used to make decisions where no room for cheating or predicting the other person’s move is allowed.

The Basic Rules of RPS

Despite its underlying complexity, the game’s rules are straightforward. Players deliver hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors, with the outcome determined by these three rules:

Rock wins against scissors.
Scissors win against paper.

Have fun!
